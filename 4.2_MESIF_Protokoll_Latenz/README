insert "read" and "max" folders at Path "benchit_folder"/kernel/arch_x86-64/memory_latency/C/pthread/0/
max:
is beeing used in Diagram 4.7 of the Thesis
contains a slightly modified version of the Kernel that is using the maximum latency of 14 Internal Runs
The Effect beeing shown in Diagram 4.7 is beeing !reduced! by using the maximum. That is to ensure that it 
is not caused by some outliers (with low latency) 
Helps to flatten the curve and getting more consistent results
BENCHIT_RUN_ACCURACY 0 (but using 14 internal Runs as seen in the PARAMETER FILE)

read: 
used in Diagram 4.5 and 4.6 the effect decribed in 4.7 will be exaggerated
in order to use the results it is recommended to use the median of one Cache-level
BENCHIT_KERNEL_CPU_LIST settings: 
	P_Core: "0,2,15,23"
	E_Core: "16,17,23,0"
BENCHIT_KERNEL_USE_MODE="E"
BENCHIT_KERNEL_FLUSH_MODE="I" obviously needs to get changed when setting BENCHIT_KERNEL_USE_MODE to "I"

setting BENCHIT_KERNEL_L(1-4)_SIZE is recommended when using  BENCHIT_KERNEL_FLUSH_(L1-L4)=1 for better results
Warning: flushing Cache-Level is not necessarily an indication of the actual capacity of the Cache-Level or/and Inclusion Behaviour
